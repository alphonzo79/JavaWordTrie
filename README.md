# JavaWordTrie
Project to build a Trie representing a word list with the intent of packaging it into a lightweight, fast jar

The packaged jar will allow the user to initialize the trie with the Sowpods word list found <a href="http://www.freescrabbledictionary.com/sowpods/">here</a> and the Enable word list found <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt">here</a>.

Sowpods: 267,751 words

Enable: 172,820 words

Both: 272,405 words
